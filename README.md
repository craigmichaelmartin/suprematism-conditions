# Suprematism Conditions

An Angular 2 conditions component.


#### Installation
```bash
npm i -S CINBCUniversal/suprematism-conditions
```
Until it is published to npm, point to github. A consequence of this is that
built files must be checked-in. When we publish to npm with `npm publish`,
there is a prehook to build the files and a posthook to delete them
(so only source files are saved in git). For now, after doing development,
we must manually run the publish prehook and save the files.
